Installation Instructions
*************************

Basic Installation
===================

spmfilter uses cmake instead of the autotools "configure" script.
CMake normally uses a separate build directory - follow these steps to configure,
build and install this package from source:

tar xvfz spmfilter-<VERSION>.tar.gz
cd spmfilter-<VERSION>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ <configure parameters>
make
make install

If you encounter problems with cmake, it may help to set these two environment
variables:

CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH



Configure Parameters
=====================

Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that the
`cmake' script does not know about.  Run `./cmake -h' for details on some of
the pertinent environment variables.

You can give `cmake' initial values for configuration parameters
by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
is an example:

	./cmake ../ -DPREFIX:STRING=/usr/local

Instead of defining parameters on the command line you can also create
the file "build.properties" in the source and define your configuration
parameters there. Here is an example for "build.properties":


	set(PREFIX /opt/spmfilter)
	set(ENABLE_DEBUG TRUE)
	set(WITHOUT_ZDB TRUE)
	set(WITHOUT_DB4 TRUE)
	set(WITHOUT_LDAP TRUE)



Installation Names
==================

By default, `make install' installs the package's commands under
`/usr/local/sbin', include files under `/usr/local/include', etc.  You
can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
`cmake' the option `-DPREFIX:STRING=/usr/local'.
